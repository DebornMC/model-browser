Display all resource pack-loaded item models directly in-game!

The mod adds a widget to the anvil GUI, similar to the recipe book, showing every model currently loaded by any resource packs. Clicking an item automatically sets its name in the anvil, making it easy to apply models using tools like the [Model Applier](https://github.com/ewanhowell5195/ModelApplier) datapack.
